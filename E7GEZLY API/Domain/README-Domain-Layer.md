# E7GEZLY Domain Layer - Clean Architecture Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete Domain Layer implementation for the E7GEZLY platform, following Clean Architecture principles. The domain layer represents the core business logic and entities of the venue-booking system serving the Egyptian market.

## Architecture Principles

### Clean Architecture Compliance
- **Dependency Rule**: Domain layer has no dependencies on external layers
- **Pure Business Logic**: All business rules are encapsulated within domain entities and services
- **Infrastructure Independence**: Domain is agnostic to databases, frameworks, and external services
- **Testability**: Pure domain logic can be tested in isolation

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Patterns
- **Aggregate Roots**: Venue, User, CustomerProfile maintain consistency boundaries
- **Value Objects**: Address, Coordinates, PersonName, VenueName provide type safety
- **Domain Events**: Capture important business occurrences for eventual consistency
- **Domain Services**: Complex business logic that doesn't belong to a single entity

## Domain Structure

### Core Building Blocks

#### Base Classes
- `BaseEntity`: Common properties for all entities (Id, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, IsDeleted)
- `AggregateRoot`: Base for aggregate roots with domain event support
- `ValueObject`: Immutable objects compared by value
- `DomainException`: Base for business rule violations

#### Domain Events
- `IDomainEvent`: Interface for all domain events
- Event implementations for venue operations, user management, and business operations

### Aggregate Roots

#### 1. User Aggregate
**Purpose**: Manages user authentication, verification, and session tracking

**Entities**:
- `User`: Main aggregate root for both venue owners and customers
- `UserSession`: Tracks user authentication sessions
- `ExternalLogin`: Social login integrations

**Key Business Rules**:
- Email/phone verification requirements based on user type
- Password reset rate limiting
- Session management and security
- External login provider validation

**Domain Events**:
- `UserRegisteredEvent`
- `UserEmailVerifiedEvent`
- `UserPhoneVerifiedEvent`
- `UserPasswordChangedEvent`
- `UserLockedOutEvent`

#### 2. Venue Aggregate
**Purpose**: Comprehensive venue management with sub-users, pricing, and operational details

**Entities**:
- `Venue`: Aggregate root managing venue information and operations
- `VenueSubUser`: Staff members with role-based permissions
- `VenueSubUserSession`: Authentication sessions for venue staff
- `VenueWorkingHours`: Operating hours configuration
- `VenuePricing`: Flexible pricing structures
- `VenueImage`: Image management with display ordering
- `VenuePlayStationDetails`: PlayStation-specific venue features
- `VenueAuditLog`: Comprehensive audit trail
- `Reservation`: Basic booking entity (to be expanded)

**Key Business Rules**:
- Profile completion requirements based on venue type
- Sub-user permission system with role hierarchy
- Founder admin cannot be deleted or have permissions modified
- Working hours validation and time slot management
- Pricing validation with deposit percentage constraints
- Audit logging for all venue operations

**Domain Events**:
- `VenueRegisteredEvent`
- `VenueProfileCompletedEvent`
- `VenueDetailsUpdatedEvent`
- `VenueSubUserCreatedEvent`
- `VenueSubUserPasswordChangedEvent`
- `VenueSubUserLoggedInEvent`

#### 3. CustomerProfile Aggregate
**Purpose**: Customer information and location management

**Entities**:
- `CustomerProfile`: Customer personal information and address

**Key Business Rules**:
- Name validation and formatting
- Age calculation and validation
- Address completeness checking
- Geographic distance calculations

**Domain Events**:
- `CustomerProfileUpdatedEvent`

#### 4. Location Entities
**Purpose**: Egyptian geographic reference data

**Entities**:
- `Governorate`: Top-level administrative divisions
- `District`: Sub-divisions within governorates

**Key Business Rules**:
- Read-only reference data
- Hierarchical relationship validation
- Arabic and English name support

### Value Objects

#### Address
- Encapsulates street address, landmark, and coordinates
- Validation for field lengths
- Coordinate integration for distance calculations

#### Coordinates
- GPS latitude/longitude with validation
- Distance calculation using Haversine formula
- Egypt boundary validation

#### PersonName
- First name and last name with validation
- Name formatting and cleaning
- Full name composition

#### VenueName
- Venue name validation and formatting
- Keyword searching capabilities
- Length and format constraints

### Domain Services

#### VenueProfileCompletionService
- Evaluates profile completion percentage
- Identifies missing requirements
- Provides improvement suggestions
- Type-specific completion rules

#### VenueAuthorizationService
- Permission checking with role-based constraints
- Sub-user management authorization
- Effective permission calculation
- Role validation for permission assignment

#### UserVerificationService
- Verification code generation and validation
- Rate limiting for verification requests
- User type-specific verification requirements
- Code expiry calculation

### Repository Interfaces

Pure abstractions defining data access needs:
- `IUserRepository`: User aggregate operations
- `IVenueRepository`: Venue aggregate with complex querying
- `ICustomerProfileRepository`: Customer profile management
- `ILocationRepository`: Geographic reference data

### Domain Enums

#### VenueEnums
- `VenueType`: PlayStation, Football Court, Padel Court, MultiPurpose
- `VenueFeatures`: Comprehensive feature flags
- `VenueSubUserRole`: Admin, Coworker
- `VenuePermissions`: Granular permission system
- `PricingType`, `PlayStationModel`, `RoomType`, etc.

## Business Rules Preservation

### Authentication & Authorization
- Multi-factor verification based on user type
- Role-based permission system for venue staff
- Session management with device tracking
- Password policies and reset limitations

### Venue Management
- Type-specific profile completion requirements
- Hierarchical permission system (Founder Admin > Admin > Coworker)
- Comprehensive audit logging for accountability
- Flexible pricing structures with deposit support

### Location & Geography
- Egyptian geographic boundaries validation
- Distance calculations for venue discovery
- Multi-language support (English/Arabic)

### Data Integrity
- Soft delete with audit trail preservation
- Optimistic concurrency with UpdatedAt timestamps
- Domain event tracking for state changes
- Comprehensive validation at entity boundaries

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies (Interfaces Only)
- Repository interfaces for data persistence
- Domain event interfaces for eventual consistency
- No direct dependencies on infrastructure concerns

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Domain events for integration with other bounded contexts
- Repository abstractions for different storage strategies
- Service interfaces for complex business operations

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Targets
- Entity business rule validation
